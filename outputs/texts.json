information\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of InterContinental Hotels \nGroup PLC (the \u2018Group\u2019 or \u2018IHG\u2019) for the year ended 31 December 2023 \nwere authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the \nDirectors on 19 February 2024. InterContinental Hotels Group PLC \n(the \u2018Company\u2019) is incorporated and registered in England and Wales.\nBasis of preparation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of IHG have been prepared", "on a going concern basis (see below) and under the historical cost \nconvention, except for assets and liabilities measured at fair value \nunder relevant accounting standards. The Consolidated Financial \nStatements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted \ninternational accounting standards and with applicable law and \nregulations, including the Companies Act 2006, and with International \nFinancial Reporting Standards (\u2018IFRSs\u2019) as issued by the International", "Accounting Standards Board (\u2018IASB\u2019). UK-adopted international \naccounting standards differ in certain respects from IFRSs as issued \nby the IASB. However, the differences have no impact on the \nConsolidated Financial Statements for the years presented.\nGoing concern\nA period of 18 months has been used, from 1 January 2024 to \n30 June 2025, to complete the going concern assessment. \nIn adopting the going concern basis for preparing the Group", "financial statements, the Directors have considered a \u2018Base Case\u2019 \nscenario, as prepared by management, which assumes continued \ngrowth in RevPAR in 2024 and 2025 in line with market expectations. \nThe assumptions applied in the Base Case scenario are consistent \nwith those used for Group planning purposes, for impairment testing \n(impairment tests adjusted for factors specific to individual properties \nor portfolios) and for assessing recoverability of deferred tax assets.", "The Directors have also reviewed a \u2018Severe Downside Case\u2019 which \nis based on a severe but plausible scenario equivalent to the market \nconditions experienced through the 2008/09 global financial crisis. \nThis assumes that the performance during 2024 starts to worsen \nand then RevPAR decreases significantly by 17% in 2025. \nA large number of the Group\u2019s principal risks would result in an \nimpact on RevPAR, which is one of the sensitivities assessed against", "the headroom available in the Base Case and Severe Downside Case \nscenarios. Climate risks are not considered to have a significant \nimpact over the 18-month period of assessment. Other principal \nrisks that could result in a large one-off incident that has a material \nimpact on cash flow have also been considered, for example a \ncybersecurity event. \nA one-year extension to the Group\u2019s revolving credit facility of \n$1,350m was exercised in 2023 and the facility now matures in", "2028. The Group\u2019s key covenant requires net debt:EBITDA below \n4.0x. See note 24 for additional information. In November 2023 \nthe Group issued a six-year \u20ac600m bond. The only debt maturity \nin the period under consideration is the \u20ac500m October 2024 \nbond which is assumed to be repaid with cash on maturity. \nUnder the Base Case and Severe Downside Case, bank covenants \nare not breached and there is significant headroom to the \ncovenants to absorb multiple additional risks and uncertainties.", "Additional funding is not required in the period under consideration. \nThe Directors also reviewed a number of actions that could be taken \nif required to reduce discretionary spend, creating substantial \nadditional headroom to the covenants.\nThe Directors reviewed a reverse stress test scenario to determine \nwhat decrease in RevPAR would create a breach of the covenants. \nThe Directors concluded that it was very unlikely that a single risk", "or combination of the risks considered could create the sustained \nRevPAR impact required, except for a significant global event. \nThe leverage and interest cover covenant tests up to 30 June 2025 \n(the last day of the assessment period) have been considered \nas part of the Base Case and Severe Downside Case scenarios. \nNeither of these scenarios indicate that a covenant amendment \nwould be required but, in the event that it was, the Directors believe", "it is reasonable to expect that such an amendment could be obtained \nbased on experience of negotiating the waivers and amendments in \n2020, however the going concern conclusion is not dependent on \nthis expectation. The Group also has alternative options to manage \nthis risk including raising additional funding in the capital markets. \nHaving reviewed these scenarios, the Directors have a reasonable \nexpectation that the Group has sufficient resources to continue", "operating until at least 30 June 2025. Accordingly, they continue to \nadopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. \nPresentational currency\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in millions \nof US dollars reflecting the profile of the Group\u2019s revenue and \noperating profit which are primarily generated in US dollars or \nUS dollar-linked currencies.\nIn the Consolidated Financial Statements, equity share capital,", "the capital redemption reserve and shares held by employee share \ntrusts are translated into US dollars at the relevant rate of exchange \non the last day of the period; the resultant exchange differences \nare recorded in other reserves.\nThe functional currency of the Company is sterling since this is a \nnon-trading holding company located in the United Kingdom that \nhas sterling denominated share capital and whose primary activity", "is the payment and receipt of sterling dividends and of interest on \nsterling denominated external borrowings and intercompany balances.\nAccounting policies\nGroup Financial Statements\n161\nIHG\u2002 |\u2002 Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023", "Critical accounting policies and the use of judgements, \nestimates and assumptions\nIn determining and applying the Group\u2019s accounting policies, \nmanagement are required to make judgements, estimates and \nassumptions. An accounting policy is considered to be critical if its \nselection or application could materially affect the reported amounts \nof assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial \nStatements, or the reported amounts of revenues and expenses", "during the reporting period, or could do so within the next \nfinancial year. \nJudgements\nSystem Fund\nThe Group operates a System Fund (the \u2018Fund\u2019) to collect and \nadminister cash assessments from hotel owners for specified \npurposes of use including marketing, reservations and the Group\u2019s \nloyalty programme, IHG One Rewards. Assessments are generally \nlevied as a percentage of hotel revenues.\nThe Fund is not managed to generate a surplus or deficit for IHG over", "the longer term, but is managed for the benefit of the IHG System \nwith the objective of driving revenues for the hotels in the System.\nIn relation to marketing and reservation services, the Group\u2019s \nperformance obligation under IFRS 15 \u2018Revenue from Contracts \nwith Customers\u2019 is determined to be the continuous performance of \nthe services rather than the spending of the assessments received. \nAccordingly, assessment fees are recognised as hotel revenues", "occur, Fund expenses are charged to the Group income statement \nas incurred and no constructive obligation is deemed to exist under \nIAS 37 \u2018Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets\u2019. \nAccordingly, no liability is recognised relating to the balance of \nunspent funds.\nNo other critical judgements have been made in applying the Group\u2019s \naccounting policies. \nEstimates\nManagement consider that significant estimates and assumptions", "are used as described below. Estimates and assumptions are \nevaluated by management using historical experience and other \nfactors believed to be reasonable based on current circumstances.\nLoyalty programme \nThe loyalty programme, IHG One Rewards, enables members to earn \npoints during each qualifying stay at an IHG branded hotel and through \nother partnerships and programmes. Members are able to consume \nthose points at a later date for free or reduced accommodation or", "other benefits. Points revenue includes hotel assessments, revenue \nfrom third-party partners and proceeds from points purchased directly \nby members. \nThe Group recognises deferred revenue in an amount that reflects \nIHG\u2019s unsatisfied performance obligations, valued at the stand-alone \nselling price of the future benefit to the member. The amount of \nrevenue recognised and deferred is impacted by \u2018breakage\u2019 (points \nthat will never be consumed). On an annual basis the Group engages", "an external actuary who uses statistical formulae to assist in the \nestimate of breakage. \nSignificant estimation uncertainty exists in projecting members\u2019 \nfuture consumption activity. In 2022 and 2021, the breakage estimate \nwas formed using pre-Covid-19 behaviour patterns as a base, but \ngiving some weight to activity since 2020 and incorporating the \nimpact of 2022 programme changes. In 2023, the breakage estimate \nhas been formed without any equivalent adjustment, reflecting", "normalising patterns of redemption behaviour. If future member \nbehaviour deviates significantly from expectations, breakage \nestimates could increase or decrease. At 31 December 2023, \ndeferred revenue relating to the loyalty programme was $1,529m \n(2022: $1,411m, 2021: $1,292m). Based on the conditions existing \nat the balance sheet date, a one percentage point decrease/increase \nin the breakage estimate relating to earned points would increase/\nreduce this liability by $75m.", "reduce this liability by $75m.\nActuarial gains and losses would correspondingly adjust the amount \nof System Fund and reimbursable revenues recognised and deferred \nrevenue in the Group statement of financial position.\nSignificant accounting policies\nBasis of consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the financial \nstatements of the Parent Company and entities controlled by \nthe Group.

A contract asset is recorded which is recognised as \na deduction to revenue over the initial term of the agreement. \nIn limited cases, loans can be provided to an owner, in such cases \nthe initial credit risk will be low. The difference, if any, between the", "face and market value of the loan on inception is recognised as \na contract asset.\nIn limited cases, the Group may provide performance guarantees \nto third-party hotel owners. The expected value of payments under \nperformance guarantees reduces the overall transaction price and is \nrecognised as a deduction to revenue over the term of the agreement.\nTypically, contract assets are not financial assets as they represent \namounts paid by the Group at the beginning of a contract, and so", "are tested for impairment based on value in use rather than with \nreference to expected credit losses. Contract assets are reviewed \nfor impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate \nthat the carrying value may not be recoverable.

As a \nforeign private issuer, IHG is required to disclose any significant \nways in which its corporate governance practices differ from those \nfollowed by US companies. These are as follows:\nBasis of regulation\nThe Code contains a series of principles and provisions. Listed \ncompanies are required to state how they have applied the Code\u2019s \nprinciples, and the provisions operate on a \u2018comply or explain\u2019 basis,", "where any areas of non-compliance should be disclosed with an \nexplanation for the non-compliance. \nIn contrast, US companies listed on the NYSE are required to adopt \nand disclose corporate governance guidelines adopted by the NYSE.\nIndependent Directors\nThe Code\u2019s principles recommend that at least half the Board, \nexcluding the Chair, should consist of independent non-executive \ndirectors.

However, it did \nnot explicitly take into consideration the NYSE\u2019s tests in reaching \nthis determination.", "this determination.\nChair and Chief Executive Officer\nThe Code recommends that the Chair and Chief Executive Officer \nshould not be the same individual to ensure that there is a clear \ndivision of responsibility for the running of the Company\u2019s business. \nThere is no corresponding requirement for US companies. The roles \nof Chair and Chief Executive Officer were, as at 16 February 2024 \nand throughout 2023, fulfilled by separate individuals.\nCommittees", "Committees\nThe Company has a number of Board Committees which are similar \nin purpose and constitution to those required for domestic companies \nunder NYSE rules.

The Company\u2019s Nomination Committee consists of the \nChair and independent Non-Executive Directors.\nThe Chair of the Company is not a member of the Audit Committee. \nAs set out on page 94, the Audit Committee is chaired by an \nindependent Non-Executive Director who, in the Board\u2019s view, has \nthe experience and qualifications to satisfy the criterion under US", "rules for an \u2018audit committee financial expert\u2019.\nNon-Executive Director meetings\nNYSE rules require that non-management Directors of US companies \nmust meet on a regular basis without management present, and \nindependent Directors must meet separately at least once per year. \nThe Code recommends: (i) the Board Chair to hold meetings with \nthe Non-Executive Directors without the Executive Directors present; \nand (ii) the Non-Executive Directors to meet at least annually without", "the Chair present to appraise the Chair\u2019s performance. The Company\u2019s \nNon-Executive Directors have met frequently without Executive \nDirectors being present, and intend to continue this practice, after \nevery Board meeting if possible.\nShareholder approval of equity compensation plans\nThe NYSE rules require that shareholders must be given the \nopportunity to vote on all equity compensation plans and material \nrevisions to those plans.

The Board does \nnot, however, explicitly take into consideration the NYSE\u2019s detailed \ndefinition of \u2018material revisions\u2019.\nCode of Conduct\nThe NYSE requires companies to adopt a code of business \nconduct and ethics, applicable to Directors, officers and employees. \nAny waivers granted to Directors or officers under such a code must \nbe promptly disclosed.
